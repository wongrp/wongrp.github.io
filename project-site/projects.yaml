    title: State Couplings for Binding Affinity
    status: active        # used for grouping into Active/Incubating/Archive
    stage: Primary        # label shown in the UI
    summary: >
      Equivariant message-passing architecture comparing apo vs. holo protein
      states (and ligand context) to predict binding affinity from learned
      state differences.

      Longer-form notes about the project can go here. This might include:
      - What you're actually trying to show.
      - Current bottlenecks or questions.
      - A rough roadmap of next experiments.

      You can keep this fairly free-form; it's just for you.

    summary: >
      Minimal MD system to test whether a state-comparison network can recover
      a low-dimensional collective variable separating metastable basins.

      Use this project page to track which CVs you've tried, how you
      evaluated them, and which diagnostics seemed most informative.

      You can paste in quick bullet lists, rough ideas, or links you care about.

  - slug: equivariant-pooling
    title: Equivariant Pooling & Graph Coarsening
    status: active
    stage: Design
    summary: >
      Exploring pooling-based graph coarsening layers that respect rotational
      symmetry while learning relevant length scales for protein–ligand systems.
    detail: |
      This is a good place to jot down toy examples, quick sketches of
      pooling operators, or references you want to remember.

      Idea: keep a short list of "experiments to run next" at the bottom.

  - slug: enhanced-sampling-cv
    title: Enhanced Sampling via Learned CVs
    status: incubating
    stage: Incubating
    summary: >
      Connect learned collective variables and committors to control /
      Schrödinger bridge ideas for targeted sampling on protein–ligand landscapes.
    detail: |
      Since this is still incubating, you can use this space mostly for
      collected references and half-baked ideas.

      When it graduates to an active project, update status to 'active'
      and tighten the description/plan.

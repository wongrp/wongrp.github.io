People have investigated heat engines, such as [Gronchi and Puglisi's Optimization of an active heat engine](https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.052134). An experimetal implementation cna be found in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42350-y#ref-CR9). This was a new topic to me so I separate my notes into [definitions and preliminaries](/pdf_docs/placeholder.pdf), then [a main set of notes](/pdf_docs/Notes_on_phase_space_overlap.pdf). 

You can also check the [Overleaf page](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ggdtmmbdbpbq#4485ea) which contains all these notes.

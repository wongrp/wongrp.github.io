Intuitively, the state coupling idea identifies *overlaps* between states. I want to know to what extent tensor products can help identify overlaps in configuration space and how that corresponds to overlaps in phase space. So I have to start with how phase space overlaps are a problem in the first place. [Wu and Kofke's 2005 paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/123/5/054103/905489/Phase-space-overlap-measures-I-Fail-safe-bias) is a great place to start and here are [my notes on it](../pdf_docs/Notes_on_phase_space_overlap.pdf).

FEP benefits from machine learning. I start from [Rizzi, Carloni and Parrinello's paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10655219/) on free energies from force fields to write my [TFEP notes](../pdf_docs/Notes_on_TFEP.pdf). Soon to come are
[CV learning notes](/path/to/cv-notes).

You can also check the [Overleaf page](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ggdtmmbdbpbq#4485ea) which contains all these notes.

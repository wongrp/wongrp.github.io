Intuitively, the state coupling idea identifies *overlaps* between states. I want to know to what extent tensor products can help identify overlaps in configuration space and how that corresponds to overlaps in phase space. So I have to start with how phase space overlaps are a problem in the first place. [Wu and Kofke's 2005 paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/123/5/054103/905489/Phase-space-overlap-measures-I-Fail-safe-bias) is a great place to start and here are [my notes on it](../pdf_docs/Notes_on_phase_space_overlap.pdf). 



FEP benefits from machine learning. Notes on that: [TFEP notes](../pdf_docs/Notes_on_TFEP.pdf) and
[CV learning notes](/path/to/cv-notes) for more details.

You can also check the [Overleaf page](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ggdtmmbdbpbq#4485ea) which contains all these notes.
